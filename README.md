# Project---Tools-for-Analytics-
Contains the project for the Tools for Analytics Course. This project involves developing a Jupyter notebook that utilizes NYC Open Data and Zillowâ€™s historical monthly rent averages to find a new apartment. The focus is on identifying a quiet neighborhood with plenty of greenery that fits within a specified budget. The notebook will manage tasks such as data downloading, cleaning, and storage, and it will implement SQL queries and visualizations to assist in the decision-making process for selecting an optimal living area.
